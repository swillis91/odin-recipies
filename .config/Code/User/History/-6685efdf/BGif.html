            <h2>Calathea/Prayer Plant Care</h2>
              <p class="care">Calatheas are a rather finicky plant, and not recommended for beginner plant parents.But, if you are new and want to take the leap on owning a Calathea, here are some tips.
                <br>
                Calatheas love to be in bright indirect light (meaning out of direct sunlight). The best way to gauge their lighting is by holding your hand above the plant. If you see a slightly defined shadow cast on the plant by your hand, that is the sweet spot. If the shadow is well defined, that may be too much light for the plant and the leaves may burn.
                <br>
                Calatheas love to have consistantly moist soil at all times. The best time to water them is if the soil is dry about 1-2 inches deep. This can be gauged by sticking your finger in the soil to the second knuckle. If no moisture is felt, it is definitely time for a watering.
