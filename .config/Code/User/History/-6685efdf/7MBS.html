            <h2>Calathea/Prayer Plant Care</h2>
              <p class="care">Calatheas require bright indirect lighting for their best growth. You do not want these plants placed in harsh direct sunlight, or their leaves may burn. Both of these species of plants do prefer to be in higher humidity environments to prevent the leaves from browning.</p>
              <p class="care">These plants are very sensitive to chemicals found in tap water such as chlorine and chloramine. It is best to water with filtered or distilled water. Another thing to note is that they like their soil to be consistantly moist, but <em>not</em> soggy. If the roots are watterlogged for too long, it wil harbor bad bacteria in the root system, causing them to rot (roots will turn black  and/or brown)</p>
