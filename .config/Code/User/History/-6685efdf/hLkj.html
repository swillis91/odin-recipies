              <p class="care">Calatheas are a rather finicky plant, and not recommended for beginner plant parents.But, if you are new and want to take the leap on owning a Calathea, here are some tips.
                <br>
                Calatheas love to be in bright indirect light (meaning out of direct sunlight). The best way to gauge their lighting is by holding your hand above the plant. If you see a slightly defined shadow cast on the plant by your hand, that is the sweet spot. If the shadow is well defined, that may be too much light for the plant and the leaves may burn.
                <br><br>
                Calatheas love to have consistantly moist soil at all times. The best time to water them is if the soil is dry about 1-2 inches deep. This can be gauged by sticking your finger in the soil to the second knuckle. If no moisture is felt, it is definitely time for a watering. Calatheas are picky about the type of water they like. The best water for these plants contains <em>no</em> chlorine, as this will cause browning on the leaves. Filtered, reverse osmosis, and distilled water would be best for your waterings.
                <br><br>
                During the growing period that begins in spring and ends in fall (unless you use a grow light to extend it's <i>sun</i> exposure) it is recommended to fertilize weekly with something like fish emulsion and liquid seaweed or kelp diluted to the ratio found on the bottle. Fertilizing regularly during the growing period will help boost the growth rate of these lovely ladies.</p>
