                <p class="care">Philodendrons come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from tall plants with beautiful large frilly leaves, to plants with smaller delicate and fuzzy leaves. These plants are by far the easiest and best suited for beginner plant owners, as they tolerate many different environments.

                <br>
                Most philodendrons prefer bright indirect lighting to grow best. Direct sunlight can burn the leaves of these plants if the light is too intense. Vining varieties do have the capability of climbing structures such as moss poles or trellises. If given the chance to climb, leaf size will increase.</p>

                <h3>Selecting Your New Plant</h3>
                <p>When selecting your new plant, be sure to completely inspect all leaves for signs of pests. You will want to look out for any tiny webs, tiny black spots, white spots, or anything out of the ordinary on the leaves. Pull the plant out of its pot to inspect the roots, you are looking for nice bright white/pale tan roots. The more roots in the pot, the better, as this indicates that the plant is well established.</p>

                <h3>Acclimating</h3>
                <p>Once you bring your new Philodendron home, you will want to let the plant acclimate due to the change in environment. Also, you will want to quarantine it away from any other plant that you may already have in your home in case you missed a pest infestation (you do <em>not</em> want an infestation of all of your plants!). Put in in a space far away from andy plants for about a week, and inspect it daily for everything you looked for on the leaves at the nursey/store.
