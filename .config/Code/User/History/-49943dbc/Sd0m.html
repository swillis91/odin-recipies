                <p class="care">Philodendrons come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from tall plants with beautiful large frilly leaves, to plants with smaller delicate and fuzzy leaves. These plants are by far the easiest and best suited for beginner plant owners, as they tolerate many different environments.

                Most philodendrons prefer bright indirect lighting to grow best. Direct sunlight can burn the leaves of these plants if the light is too intense. Vining varieties do have the capability of climbing structures such as moss poles or trellises. If given the chance to climb, leaf size will increase.
