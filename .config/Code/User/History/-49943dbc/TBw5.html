                <p class="care">Philodendrons come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from tall plants with beautiful large frilly leaves, to plants with smaller delicate and fuzzy leaves. These plants are by far the easiest and best suited for beginner plant owners, as they tolerate many different environments.

                <br>
                Most philodendrons prefer bright indirect lighting to grow best. Direct sunlight can burn the leaves of these plants if the light is too intense. Vining varieties do have the capability of climbing structures such as moss poles or trellises. If given the chance to climb, leaf size will increase.</p>

                <h3>Selecting Your New Plant</h3>
                <p>When selecting your new plant, be sure to completely inspect all leaves for signs of pests. You will want to look out for any tiny webs, tiny black spots, white spots, or anything out of the ordinary on the leaves. Pull the plant out of its pot to inspect the roots, you are looking for nice bright white/pale tan roots. The more roots in the pot, the better, as this indicates that the plant is well established.</p>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Acclimating</h3>
                <p>Once you bring your new Philodendron home, you will want to let the plant acclimate due to the change in environment. Also, you will want to quarantine it away from any other plant that you may already have in your home in case you missed a pest infestation (you do <em>not</em> want an infestation of all of your plants!). Put in in a space far away from andy plants for about a week, and inspect it daily for everything you looked for on the leaves at the nursey/store. If you do find that you missed spotting pests, please visit <a href='./problems'>Common Problems</a> to learn more.
                <br><br>
                Once your quarantine period is over, I highly suggest repotting. Commercial greenhouses tend to pot their plants in a coco coir mix that retains moisture for long periods of time, and it is also low in nutrients. A good blend that I have found for my personal collection is 2 parts potting soil, 1 part vermiculite or perlite, 1 part orchid bark, and a handful of horticultural charcoal. I have found this mix allows the roots to breath on top of being well draining </p>

                <h3>Care and Feeding</h3>
                    <p>Philodendrons do not like to sit in soggy soil for long periods of times, as this can cause the roots to harbor bad bacteria and fungus that will cause their roots to rot. It is suggested to water them when the top 2 inches of soil is dry. This can be gauged by either sticking your finger in the soil to feel for moisture, or with a moisture meter (*please note that moisture meters can be very unreliable) or, if you are experienced in plant care, by feeling the weight of the pot. If the pot feels much lighter than when it was freshly watered, that means it is probably time for a watering.</p>
